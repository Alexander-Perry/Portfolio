                    <p>
                        My name is Alex and this is my story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey into coding began back in the early 2000s as a teenager with access to the family
                        PC, spending countless nights <i>(nights that I should have been doing homework!)</i> browsing
                        tutorials and forums learning how websites work.
                        <br>Within a year I had landed my first gig as a junior web developer at W3B Design, where I
                        worked for a few months performing
                        website maintenance, image editing and learning from the Senior developers within the company,
                        before shifting my
                        focus back to high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jump to 2007, I had moved into Telecommunications working Tech Support; where
                        after a few years, moving into senior support roles learnt about the wonderful world of
                        automation scripts that were used for reporting and network testing, and wondered why I had not
                        utilised something like this sooner.
                        <i>
                            ...After spending plenty of time studying Google and my hair turning grey... I had
                            automated over 90% of my job down to just a few button clicks.
                        </i>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, and through a number of different roles, I have developed a number of
                        internal projects to fill system gaps, automate tasks and
                        perform reporting and notification functions, as well as developed a love of Excel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I work as the Incident Manager for our SMB division; where I look after the Service
                        Assurance space supporting complex-services.
                        <br>I aspire to become a Full-Stack Developer on a Professional level, being able to shift from
                        small-scale support projects, into large-scale impact-driven systems.
